# Magic the Gathering Cards: Project 3

Our group used the following API: https://docs.magicthegathering.io/#documentationsdks to get all the cards from Magic the Gathering. 
Our program
1) Displays the cards through various possible settings
2) Sorts them by their Mana Cost through Merge Sort and Quick Sort
3) Times each of the sorting algorithms perfomed.

We have also included an exclusive set of cards that can be used in the same settings as above.
This set consists of 100,000 randomly generated names and each card includes the same properties as regular Magic the Gathering cards.
